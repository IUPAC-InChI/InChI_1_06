This directory contains binaries of command line InChI executable (inchi-1) 
and InChI API library (libinchi). The 32 and 64 bit versions are supplied 
for both Windows and Linux. 

Also included is winchi-1.exe, a graphical Windows application
(directory 'windows'; a 32 bit version which will also run under 64 bit Windows).

Note that:

* InChI stand-alone executable inchi-1[.exe] does not require dll/so libraries.

* To use the shared library, you may wish to create 'libinchi.so.1' 
as a symbolic link to 'libinchi.so.1.06.00'
