This directory contains a simple test suite for InChI version 1, 
software version 1.06.

Included are: 
a) zipped source structural data (in SDF format);
b) zipped reference result files containing InChI strings (in several cases, 
accompanied by InChIKey strings) generated from the source data by InChI 
software v. 1.06 executable inchi-1 with different command-line options;
c) scripts used to generate the reference identifiers.

The source data includes a minimal set of chemical structures presented 
as a single SDfile, InChI_TestSet.sdf. Samples containing polymer
structures and Zz pseudo atoms are in zzp.sdf dataset.
